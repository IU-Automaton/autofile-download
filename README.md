--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Introduction

This task allows you to download stuff. Simply provide the URL and destination in the file system, and the task handles the rest for you.

## Requirements

If your task requires something from the environment in which it runs that can't be guaranteed through `package.json`, you should mention it here, and give directions on how to get those installed (linking to another *"how to install"* is fine).


## Usage

A concise description of how to use the task. If the task can accomplish a lot, consider breaking this section into several subsections, each incrementing on the previous, possibly with multiple examples.

### Options

Here's a list of the options that this task can take:

- `*files`: An object with the links (keys) and destination location (values).
- `concurrency` *(0)*: The maximum concurrent downloads. 0 is unlimited.


### Example
